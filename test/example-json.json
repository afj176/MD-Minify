But when I move to production, I normally put together a build setup that optimizes the code for production.\r\n\r\n> Email-style angle brackets\r\n> are used for blockquotes.\r\n\r\n> > And, they can be nested.\r\n\r\n> #### Headers in blockquotes\r\n> \r\n> * You can quote a list.\r\n> * Etc.    \r\n\r\n## Optional Helper Shell Script\r\n\r\nThe `site` file is a helper script that will take care of setting up a new directory for you to start working on your new site. This script will first create the directory then export all the needed files (without the `.git` directory or any `.git*` files) to the new directory. This is the preferred method of utilizing this template framework.\r\n\r\nYou can use the `site` command via the command line, like this:\r\n\r\n    ./site /path/to/new/site\r\n\r\nYou may need to mark this script as executable before using it:\r\n\r\n    chmod +x site\r\n\r\nFinally, you can move this file to /usr/bin to use the `site` command from any directory. If you do this, be sure to uncomment the `cd ~/Development...` line and update the path to the location of this git repository on your local computer.\r\n\r\nThat's some text with a footnote.[^1]\r\n\r\n[^1]: And that's the footnote."
